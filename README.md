# complex-sensible.vim

A vim configuration adapted to my workflow. The plugin can be automatically loaded with [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), together with other plugins, as shown in the vimrc file. For instance, a way to quickly configure vim (including dictionaries for the spell checker) can be done copy/pasting the following commands:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marblestation/vim-complex-sensible/master/bin/install.sh -sSf | sh && reset
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marblestation/vim-complex-sensible/master/bin/install-dictionaries.sh -sSf | sh
```
